# newProjects
This is a my first React Native app.
It is a smple app that sign you into the "inbox" screen.
In there you can go to creat a new "message" that contin a "title" and a "body".
Click "send" the app will take you back to the "inbox" to browse the "messages".
You can see the "titles" if you press it you will get the whole "message".
